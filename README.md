# JavaGameProject
This is my java game project of the Greek Olympics. Using GUI, I created a game with 2 events: archery and running, each with 3 levels of increasing difficulty. Linked below is my video demo of the game that I submitted as part of the assignment:

In this code, I utilized image editing software to enhance the visual effects of the game. Instead of a simple JButton, I used an image of a button that increased in brightness when clicked in order to give the illusion of being clicked.
